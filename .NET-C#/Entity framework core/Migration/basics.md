# Migrations basics

What is a migration:\
A migration represents a version of the database, sort of like a git commit. Changes to the db model is
documented by creating a migration file, which then is applied to the DB to make the changes there or 
used to run a script.

EF Core migrations are source-control friendly.
Whatever that means..
