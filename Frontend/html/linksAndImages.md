    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Absolute links, use for directing users to different websites</li>
    <li>Relative links are used for files in the project that are close to the 
        file we want to use them in. This is to that the path doesn't get too long and complicated</li>
    <li>For files far away we use root-relative links, they are relative to the root as opposed to the current file, and
        always start with a /
    </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>JPEG: good for images with lots of gradients and colors in them. Cannot have transparent pixels</li>
        <li>GIF: use for animations. Do not have great detail in transparent images, use PNG if you don't need animations</li>
        <li>PNG: great for anything that isn't an animation or a photo, for photos JPEG will take a lot less space</li>
        <li>SVG: vector based, can be scaled up or down to any size without loss of quality</li>
    </ul>
