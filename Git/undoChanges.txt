git revert <commit>

creates a new commit that undoes everything in the chosen commit
the revert and the reverted commit will be visible in the history,
but we can continue using the same branch as before

git reset --hard <commit>
resets the branch to the chosen commit. Newer commits no longer exist
in the commit history. Continue work as if the mistakes never happened
A solution for local commits, not public once
