Adds staged changes to the content for the previous commit.
Behind the scenes this creates a new commit that replaces the old one,
to git it will look like a brand new commit and the previous one will 
no longer be on the branch
The metadata for these two commits will be different

git commit --amend
git commit --amend -m ""        //if a new commit message is desirable
git commit --amend --no-edit    //amend to commit without changing the commit message


NB! Do not amend to public commits! This is because other developers 
might have based their work om the previous commit that will no longer 
be on the current branch
