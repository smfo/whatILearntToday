# Git bash commands
Can also be used in others consoles

## Exit bash editor
The editor is the little hell between you and your commit being pushed as you like. It pops up when there's a merge conflict when doing more complicated stuff like `git rebase -i` etc.

`i` to get into editing and actually be able to write in this window.\
`ESC` to get out of editing and into the "terminal" at the bottom of the editor.

Exit editor, no save:\
:q! + enter

Save and quit:\
:wq + enter

## Simple commands

git branch -a: view all branches
git log: log all commits
q (+ enter): exit branch log without having to go all the way to the end
