# Stash

Use stash when you want to go back to a clean working directory, but want to keep the changes you have made there to use later.

Typically used when checking out a new branch.

## Stash all changes

This will stash everything in the working directory with a autogenerated name.

```c
git stash

git checkout <branch>

git stash pop
```

## Stash with specific name

Stash changes with a given name.

```c
git stash push -m <stash name>
```

## Stash parts of file

Works the same way as git add patch.

```
git stash -p -m <stash name>
```

## View all stashes

Lists all the current stashes.

```c
$ git stash list
stash@{0}: On results-filtering-bug: Use test database
stash@{1}: On results-filtering-bug: Use local GDS
```

## Apply stash

This will apply the stash you are selecting while still keeping it in the stash list.\
Ideal for changes you want to do often but don't want to commit. Ex. connect to the test db from localhost.

```c
git stash apply "stash@{n}"

// Shorthand
git stash apply n
```

## Apply and delete stash

The stashed changes are taken from the stash list and applied to the current branch. The stash in the stash list is deleted.

`git stash pop = git stash apply + git stash drop`

```c
git stash pop "stash@{n}"

// Shorthand
git stash pop n
```

## Delete stash

Delete a stash from the stash list.

```c
// Drops top stash
git stash drop

// Drops the specific stash
git stash drop stash@{n}
git stash drop n
```
