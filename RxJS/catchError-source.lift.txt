catchError catches errors on the observable handeled by returning a new observable or throw an error

Throw error
catchError(err => {throw 'error in source. Details: ' + err;})

Continue with different observable
catchError(err => of('I', 'II', 'III', 'IV', 'V'))

Retry with the caugth observable (similar to retry())
catchError((err, caught) => caught)



Errormessage:
source.lift is not a function

error created because of misplaced or missing catcherror operator

the operator shouldn't be sent as a paramater of any other RxJS operators, but added
after the relevant operator like all the others

map(result => {
		return ( do something
		),
catchError(error => this.handleError(error))
