## Electric circuit
A closed loop that carries electricity

### Electric current (I)
The flow of electrons in a circuit.\
The arrows always show the direction of the "protons", the hole current.

Amps: how many charges are going through the wire per second. Higher amps = more movement.
Current (I, amps) = Voltage / Resistance (Ohm)

### Voltage (V)
Has nothing to do with movement.\
The "push" that causes the current to flow. The source of energy that keeps the current moving.

Volt: higher voltage = more potential to move current through a circuit.

### Resistance (R)
Opposes the current flow in a circuit.

Ohm: Higher resistance = lets less current through

### DC and AC
DC: direct current - constant current flow
the voltage is constant so the surrent is as well
battery etc

AC: alternating current - the current moves back and forth
wall socket etc

Whats the point?
Its easier to produce and transmitting alternating current in power plants, where electricity 
is generated by movement.\
Direct current is created by chemical reactions.

## Open circuit
A "broken" circuit, the current cannot flow back to the start of the circuit.

## Short circuit
The curcuit is cut short by a mistake. The current does not go thourough the entire curcuit like it
is supposed to but takes a shortcut because the resistance here is lower that in the full circuit.
