# Intro to firebase

Platform to implement mobile and web applications.

Services are closely dependant, unlike azure, AWS etc. Makes it easy to use them together, but it's not that easy to move some of services to other platforms.

Event-driven architecture (real time apps without websocket).

No cloud functions in paid plan.\
Authentication, analytics (google), app distribution, crashlytics mm always free.
