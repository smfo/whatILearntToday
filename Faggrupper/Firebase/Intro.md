# Intro to firebase

Platform to implement mobile and web applications.

Services are closely dependant, unlike azure, AWS etc. Makes it easy to use them together, but it's not that easy to move some of services to other platforms.

Event-driven architecture (real time apps without websocket).

No cloud functions in paid plan.\
Authentication, analytics (google), app distribution, crashlytics mm always free.

## Projects and apps

A project is where all your resources are stored, db, authentication, security rules etc.\
It can contain multiple apps, these are just platform variants of the same application.
