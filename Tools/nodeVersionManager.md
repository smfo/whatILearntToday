# Node version manager

Used to be able ut have multiple versions of npm installed. Some projects require that they are run on specific versions.

- Download and install nvm
  in cmd
- `nvm install version` (ex. nvm install 12.14.1)
- `nvm use version` (ex. nvm use 12.14.1)

Can also be used to install latest versjon, by droping the last version speciation (nvm install 12.14).

`nvm use` sets the global node version.
