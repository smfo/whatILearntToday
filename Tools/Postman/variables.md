# Variables

## Global variables

These are global.. And apply to all collections and environments.

## Environment variables:
Create multiple environments to easily access and change parameter values in a project. The chosen environment is
displayed in the top right corner.\
Current values are private to the user, while initial values are shared with the team.
Use the variables by typing ```{{variableName}}```, in the url, authentication tab or any other tabs I guess.

## Collection variables

Variales that apply to that collection.\ 
They can be found by clicking the collection and going to the "variables" tab.

## Initial value

This is the shared value of the variable. In a shared collection all members will see this.

## Current value

The value that is actually used for this variable in your session. These will not be shared with other members of the workspace.

Secrets can be an example of variables where you don't want an initial value, just the empty variable being shared.
