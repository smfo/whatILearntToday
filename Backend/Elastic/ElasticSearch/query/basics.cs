// must match: required

// must not match: undesierable

// these are boolean queries and affects the documents relevance scoreÂ¨
// the higher the score the better the document matches the search criteria and
// the higher on the hits list it is placed (default behaviour)



// there are two types of queries
// Leaf query clauses: these look for a particular value in a particular field, 
// ex. match, term, range. these queries can be used by themselves
// Compound query clauses: wrap other leaf or compound queries and are used to 
// combine multiple queries to alter their behavior. ex. bool, dis_max


// relevance score
// measure how well each document matches the query, the higher the _score the more
// relevant the document is for the search. each query type can calculate the scores
// differently, but the score calculation also depends on weather the query clause is 
// run in a query or filter context

// query and filter context
// in query context, the query clause answer the question
// "how does this document match this query clause?", in addition to this the query clause
// also calculates a relevant score in the _score meta-field
// we have a query context every time a query clause is passed to a query parameter
// in a filter context the query clause answers the question
// "Does this document match this query clause?", this gives a yes/no answer, no score is calculated
// we have a query context whenever a query clause id passed to a filter parameter, such as 
// filter or must_not

// 1: the query parameter inducates a query context
// 2: the bool and the match clauses are used in query context, which means they are used
// to score how well each document matches the criteria
// 3: the filter parameter indicates filter context. its term and range clause are used
// in filter context. they will filter out documents which does not match, nowever they
// will not affect the score for the matching documents

// (isn't it better to filter first, so you don't have to calculate the score for the
// documents that are filtered out?)

// note: 
// Use query clauses in query context for conditions which should affect the score of matching 
// documents (i.e. how well does the document match), and use all other query clauses in filter context.
